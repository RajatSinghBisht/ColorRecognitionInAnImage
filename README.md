# ColorRecognitionInAnImage
Colour detection is necessary to recognize objects, it is also used as a tool in various image editing and drawing apps.

Colour detection is the process of detecting the name of any colour.
For humans this is an extremely easy task but for computers, it is not straightforward. Human eyes and brains work together to translate light into colour. Light receptors that are present in our eyes transmit the signal to the brain. Our brain then recognizes the colour.

In this colour detection Python project, we are going to build an application through which we can automatically get the name of the colour by clicking on them. So for this, we will have a data file that contains the colour name and its values. Then we will calculate the distance from each colour and find the shortest one.
